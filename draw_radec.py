Draw random SNe redshifts 

Note: The convention for spherical coordinates used here is
      azimuth (i.e. RA or l) first and then inclination (i.e. Dec or b).
      All angles are given in degrees within azimuths of -180 degrees and 180 degrees
      and inclinations between -90 degrees and 90 degrees.
